Hey :)

For the project I have used:
* React
* vite for running and building
* and jest/testing-library/babel for testing

To install dependencies you can run
```
npm install
```

To start the project in dev mode, website will start on port 3000 by default, run:
```
npm run dev
```

To build production version, default build directory is "dist", run:
```
npm run build
```

To preview the build version live (this requiers to build first), run:
```
npm run preview
```

To start the tests, run:
```
npm run test
```

kind regards,
Maya
